## Prerequisites

- [uv](https://github.com/kirenz/uv-setup) installed (manages dependencies and virtual environment)
- A Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys)

## Setup

1. **Clone or download the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChronicleOfZealvy/Agentic_AI_Project.git
   ```

   Navigate into the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd gradio-adk-intro
  ```

2. **Install dependencies** (also creates the virtual environment)

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Get your API key** (free) from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys)


4. **Configure your API key**

   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the project root, and add your Google API key:

   ```bash
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=YourApiKeyHere
   ```

**Important**: The `.env` file is already listed in `.gitignore` and will **not** be committed to the repository, keeping your key private.


## Running the Application

### Option 1: Run with Gradio (Web UI)

Start the Time Agent application with Gradio interface:

```bash
uv run app.py
```

> **Note**: You may see a warning about "App name mismatch detected" - this can be safely ignored.

### Option 2: Run with ADK Web

From the root directory, run with ADK web:

```bash
uv run adk web
```

This will start the ADK web interface where you can interact with the agent.
